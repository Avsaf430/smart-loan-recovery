# ⚡ Smart Loan Recovery System

This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict loan recovery based on borrower details such as loan amount, income, and credit score.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

✔ **Python** for data processing and model development  
✔ **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
✔ **Scikit-learn** for machine learning  
✔ **Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly** for data visualization  

## 📌 Methodology

1️⃣ **Data Analysis** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns  
2️⃣ **Feature Engineering** - Selecting key attributes for model training  
3️⃣ **Model Training** - Training a machine learning model for loan recovery prediction  
4️⃣ **Evaluation** - Assessing model performance using validation metrics  

## 🚀 Execution

▶ Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
▶ Train the model using the Jupyter notebook  
▶ Evaluate the model performance with test data  

A streamlined solution for loan recovery prediction. ✅
